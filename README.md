Yotei is a user-friendly website designed to simplify class schedule organization and coordination for CSULB students. With a database encompassing approximately 250,000 classes spanning from 2008 to 2023, our platform offers an intuitive interface for searching, viewing, and sorting through courses of interest. Users can effortlessly add and manage classes within a visually intuitive planner, with automatic highlighting of overlapping schedules and time conflicts. Detailed class information, including class type, section groups, professors, course numbers, times, locations, and additional instructions, is presented clearly. In addition, we've seamlessly integrated professor profiles from RateMyProfessor.com, further enriching the user experience and significantly improving resource accessibility for students. 

## Development Goals

While this project currently enables users to effortlessly view, add, and organize their class schedules, there is tremendous potential for further enhancements to elevate and enrich the user experience. The following list encompasses forthcoming features to be implemented.

- Automatic generation of viable schedules with little to no time conflicts displayed intuitively for easy comparison.
- Enable users to add their personal unavailable time slots, like work hours, to their preferred schedules.
- Periodically refresh the database based on a predefined schedule for the scraper to operate.
- Scrape and present key RateMyProfessor highlights.
